                   In the beginning, when silence cloaked the deep and the void lay waiting for voice, the Eternal spoke. “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light” (Genesis 1:3). 
                   That first radiance was no mere spark—it was life unfurling. It was the breath of order, the unveiling of being. From that first dawn came all rhythm and reason.
                   The Gospel remembers: “In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not” (John 1:4–5).
                   Christ, the uncreated Light, became the heartbeat of creation, the firstborn of existence, the lamp within every soul that dares to awaken. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Light is not gentle neutrality; it is holy separation. “And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness” (Genesis 1:4).
                    In that act, all moral vision was born—the line between deceit and truth, between chaos and harmony. As it was then, so it is now: the Son of Man walks among men declaring,
                    “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world” (John 11:9). Those who dwell in this day live by the will of God.
                    They are the children of clarity, the keepers of dawn, their hearts transparent before the Father of lights.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And the light bears fruit. It does not bloom in secret but manifests in deed. “For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth” (Ephesians 5:9).
                    From its glow springs kindness, from its warmth flows purity. It purges the heart of shadow and fills it with fragrance—the quiet scent of holiness.
                    As light nourishes the flower to open, so Christ’s presence awakens the hidden seed within man until it shines with unborrowed brightness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By this same light we see, and seeing, we lead. “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid… Let your light so shine before men,
                    that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 5:14–16). To walk in light is to become a guidepost in the dusk of others, a candle that kindles courage. 
                    The righteous do not rule by force but by reflection—by radiating the calm authority of love lived in truth.
                </p>

                <blockquote>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. - Matthew 5:14</blockquote>

                <p>
                   When the hidden deeds of men are laid bare before the brightness of God, life gains new music. The soul breathes again, and creation, long waiting in travail, rejoices. 
                   For all things were made for illumination. Darkness suffocates, but light liberates—fields bloom brighter, hearts grow tender, even the winds seem to whisper praise.
                   The universe hums when man walks rightly, when the sons of Adam shine as sons of God 
                </p>

                <p>
                  And man himself—fragile, fallen, yet chosen—becomes the mirror of divine splendor. “God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts,
                  to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6). Through union with Christ, the true image of God, man becomes radiance incarnate.
                  The glory once hidden behind cherubim now gleams in mortal eyes. In every act of mercy, every truth spoken, heaven glances through human flesh.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then comes peace—the calm after illumination. For the soul lit by truth no longer wanders. “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?” (Psalm 27:1).
                    Enlightenment is rest, not exhaustion; it is the stillness of a heart that sees. In this light, fear dissolves, striving ceases, and the soul reclines beneath the eternal morning—where no night falls, and the light itself is God.
