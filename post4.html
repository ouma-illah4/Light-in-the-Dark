                    Nothing is hidden from the eyes of God. As Scripture declares, “God is greater than our hearts, and He knows all things” (<strong>1 John 3:20</strong>). 
                    Our vulnerability before Him is precious, for even before our lips form the words, He already knows what we need 
                    (<strong>Matthew 6:8</strong>). Honest prayer is not about polished speech but about opening our hearts completely before the One who sees within.
                </p>

                <p>
                     It is the Father’s good pleasure to give to His children. We who are flawed still know how to give good gifts to those we love, 
                     yet how much more will our Father in heaven—whose greatness cannot be measured and whose faithfulness endures through all generations—
                     give good things to those who ask Him (<strong>Matthew 7:7–11</strong>). Honest prayer aligns our desires with His generous heart.
                </p>

                <p>
                     When the soul is weighed down with sorrow, and when words fail us, God still hears. Our sighs and groans are ever before Him; 
                     even our silence is not lost. For the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words, 
                     searching our hearts and praying according to the will of God (<strong>Romans 8:26–27</strong>). 
                     In our weakness, His strength draws near.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Honest prayer must be rooted in truth and offered in faith, seeking not our will but His. 
                    The will of the Father is to conform us into the image and likeness of His Son, 
                    who is the righteousness of God revealed. In Christ, we find both the pattern and the power of true prayer—
                    a surrender that brings transformation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through Him we have access to every promise. It is in His name we receive grace to help us in time of need. 
                    The power of honest prayer is not in eloquence or emotion but in the purity of a heart made right before God. 
                    When we approach Him sincerely, heaven bends low, and grace flows freely from His throne.
