                    From the very beginning, God declared, “It is not good for man to be alone.” Humanity was made in His image
                    and likeness—created for relationship, for communion both with God and with one another. Our longing to belong is not weakness;
                    it’s divine design. In Ephesians 5, Paul reveals that marriage itself points to a greater mystery—Christ and the Church.
                    Jesus, the true image of the invisible God, draws us into union with Himself so that His own life—light, love, and holiness—flows through us.
                     In Him we are never truly alone; we are joined to the Source of all life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet, our fellowship with Christ extends outward into His body, the Church.
                    Scripture teaches that “we are members one of another,” and “if one part suffers, every part suffers with it.” 
                    God identifies so completely with His people that Isaiah says, “In all their affliction He was afflicted.” 
                    When we carry each other’s burdens, comfort the weary, and walk together in truth and love, we reflect His heart. 
                    These acts of shared compassion are called spiritual sacrifices, and God delights in them. It is upon such unity that He commands His blessing—life forevermore.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Where can i go from your Spirit?
                    Or where can i flee from your presence?" - Psalms 139:7
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                   Still, there are seasons when pain feels private and unseen. In those moments, the psalmist reminds us that “a broken spirit and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.” 
                   The tears you hide, the prayers you can’t form, the heaviness you can barely explain—all of it is known to Him. “My sighing is not hidden from You,” says David, and that truth still holds.
                   God counts every sigh as prayer, every longing as a seed of hope. He is not distant from your distress; He is near to the crushed in spirit. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   So when loneliness presses in, remember whose image you bear and whose body you belong to. The same Christ who entered our sorrow now abides within it, transforming isolation into communion. 
                   Your struggle is not wasted—it’s woven into a story larger than yourself, a story of divine presence and redeeming love. In the quiet battlefields of the soul, you are never truly alone;
                    the Light Himself stands beside you.
