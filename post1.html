                     Life isn’t always bright. There are moments when darkness feels heavier than the air itself — when you can’t see tomorrow clearly. But even in such times, one truth remains unshaken: <strong>the light of Christ still shines.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                     Darkness doesn’t mean God is absent. Sometimes, it’s the very space where faith learns to breathe again. In your tears, prayers, and stillness, God is working unseen — shaping hope, refining your heart, and teaching you to see differently.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                     “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” – John 1:5
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                     You might not feel strong, but grace doesn’t depend on your strength — it flows through surrender. The moment you stop trying to carry it all alone, light begins to break through.
                </p>

                <p>
                     Keep holding on. Even the longest night ends when the sun rises — and in Christ, dawn is guaranteed.
