                   God’s care for us runs deeper than words can measure. Jesus reminded us that even the hairs on our heads are numbered—each strand accounted for in divine attention.
                   If He feeds the sparrows that neither sow nor reap, and clothes the lilies that neither toil nor spin, how much more will He care for those made in His image, 
                   the very pinnacle of His creation? The universe itself bends in rhythm with His love, whispering a single truth: we are not forgotten, and we will not be forsaken. 
                   If the ground yields fruit by His word, surely our lives, rooted in His grace, will not wither. 
                </p>

                   Yet overthinking often creeps in like a quiet storm. It begins with the subtle lies: “There isn’t enough for me,” “I am not good enough,” or “God must be tired of forgiving me.”
                   These thoughts grow louder than faith when we forget who our Father is. They are not born from truth but from unbelief—the ancient whisper that God is holding something back.
                   But Scripture tells us otherwise: in Christ, God has already supplied all our needs. Every spiritual blessing in heavenly places has been granted, every promise finds its “Yes” and “Amen” in Him. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   Overthinking is the mind’s attempt to control what only trust can hold. It is faith turned inward, a dialogue with doubt rather than with God. 
                   The antidote, however, is not striving harder or silencing thoughts by force—it is a return to childlike faith. The kind of faith that looks up, rests, and believes that the Father’s hands are steady.
                   Christ calls us into that simplicity again: to trust that His love does not fluctuate with our emotions, and that His plans are not threatened by our weakness. 
                </p>

                <blockquote>Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding. - Proverbs 3:5</blockquote>

                <p>
                    God is not against us; He is for us with fierce intention. He delights in our growth and rejoices in our becoming. Every correction, every delay, every silence is pregnant with purpose.
                    His desire is not merely to sustain us but to make us flourish—spiritually, emotionally, and even in the daily provisions of life. To doubt His care is to forget His nature; to trust Him again is to remember who He has always been.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When your thoughts roar louder than faith, pause and listen deeper. Beneath the noise is a still, unchanging truth: you are loved beyond comprehension. The cross was proof enough. 
                    Let that awareness still your racing thoughts. For if God did not withhold His own Son, how will He not also, with Him, graciously give you all things?
