        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Born from struggle, this space acknowledges the divisions within every soul — the shadow of depression, the grip of addiction, and the battles we often hide. 
          Here, those broken pieces are recognized and brought together, illuminating that even in division, God’s light restores wholeness.

          We aim to help hearts understand the patterns of struggle and guide them toward hope and connection.
